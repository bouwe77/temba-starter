# Temba Starter Project

Use this starter to get a simple REST API up and running quickly with [Temba](https://github.com/bouwe77/temba).

[Temba](https://github.com/bouwe77/temba) is a package for creating simple REST APIs with data stored either in memory, a JSON file, or MongoDB.

From the [Temba docs](https://github.com/bouwe77/temba/blob/main/readme.md):

> Get a simple REST API with zero coding in less than 30 seconds (seriously).
>
> For developers that need a quick NodeJS backend for small projects.

## Getting Started

1. Create your Temba server:

```bash
npx create-temba-server@latest my-rest-api
```

2. Start your server:

```bash
cd my-rest-api && npm start
```

3. Send requests to the server with your app or favorite HTTP client.

More about Temba and how to configure it, see the [Temba docs](https://github.com/bouwe77/temba#readme).
